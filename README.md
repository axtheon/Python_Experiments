# 🧪 Python Experiments

Welcome to my collection of beginner Python projects!  
These are **Projects** I’ve been working on while learning Python — either by following along with my course or by just stumbling around and trying to apply new methods into small projects.

I upload them here so I can track my progress and see how my coding skills improve over time. 🚀

## 📂 What you’ll find here
- **Simple Calculator** → Basic math operations with error handling.  
- **Password Unlock System** → A small security-style project with limited attempts.  
- **Guessing Game (Prank)** → A fun random-number game with a fake “C drive delete” message.  
- **Eligibility Checker** → A program to check if a student qualifies for BSSE, BSCS, or BSIT.  
- **Shape Area Calculator** → Finds the area of a triangle, parallelogram, or rhombus using user input.  
And many more SOON!

## ⚡ Note
Some of these are **not advanced projects**.  
They are my first steps in programming and help me practice:
- Input handling  
- Conditional statements  
- Loops  
- Error handling  
- Basic functions  
etc.

## 🎯 Why I Upload These
- To keep a record of my growth as a programmer  
- To learn how to use GitHub properly  
- To build confidence in sharing my code

## 🌱 What’s Next
As I continue learning, I’ll keep improving these projects and adding new ones.  
This repo is like my coding diary — small now, but it will grow with me.
